            <h2>Food for a family</h2>
            <p>Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado, flood,
                hurricane or blizzard. Texas families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit from being prepared
                in the event of disaster. Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the immediate few days after
                the disaster can reduce stress, worry and inconvenience.</p>

            <h2>Shelter for a family</h2>
            <p>Shelter means protection during period of crisis. The people of Bangladesh, a
                country prone to natural disasters, are familiar with the ‘Cyclone Shelter’. But
                the concept of flood shelter is relatively new. Traditionally, embankments are
                most commonly used as shelters during floods. Considering the geography of the
                country and the amount of floodwater that passes through it during the monsoon
                period, it may easily be seen that building embankments are not feasible in many
                areas of the country. In those areas flood shelter may be a very effective tool for
                coping with flood. . </p>

                    their homes, their jobs, even their loved ones. Whether it's donating a dollar or volunteering to
                    rebuild damaged houses, there are a several ways to lend a helping hand to those in need.</p>
